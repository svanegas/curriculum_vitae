        even run out of stock really fast. That is so because the idea is to offer access to
        exclusive promos.

Lecturer and student coordinator \\
\textit{January 2014 - Now (2 years 8 months)} \\
Coordinating students and teaching several Computer Science topics involved in Competitive

\textbf{Mobile Devices Development Seminar at Universidad EAFIT} \\
\textit{Member} \\
\textit{January 2015 - July 2015 (6 months)} \\
I joined this seminar because I really like developing for mobile devices, specially for
\textbf{Android}. In this seminar we created applications from good ideas that could help
students in their life. I've been through two projects in this group.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Campus M√≥vil:} This application allowed EAFIT University students to easily locate
                               buildings and important places inside the campus.
  \item \textbf{Exams:} \emph{(Not completed yet)} The idea was to have a data base of previous
                        exams of a particular subject. User could upload a picture of his own exam
                        (share it), and search for exams by subject name, teacher name and other
                        parameters.
