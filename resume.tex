\section{SUMMARY}

Back end, mobile and web developer with experience designing, developing and deploying several
applications, platforms and projects using Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Android, AngularJS, GruntJS, Gulp.js
and Docker. I have a proficient experience in Competitive Programming Contests, ranging from local
practice contests to South America finals. Furthermore, I have lectured the EAFIT's Competitive
Programming Seminar since January 2014. I really like to always concentrate of the quality of the
products, I worry about follow the best practices and guidelines while developing. I always care
about learning from my teammates, I like to research and learn about tools, frameworks, new
languages and algorithms that will improve my performance.

\section{EXPERIENCE AND PROJECTS}

\textbf{Web Developer - Software Engineer at Talos Digital, Inc.} \\
\textit{January 2016 - Now (1 month)} \\
Developing applications in multiple technologies, such as \textbf{Ruby}, \textbf{Ruby on Rails} and
\textbf{AngularJS}, automating tasks using \textbf{GruntJS} and \textbf{Gulp.js}, building
applications using Docker basics. Learning Bootstrap and CSS, using Less.js and Sass precompilers.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Flare App} \\
        \textit{January 2016 - Now (1 month)} \\
        Flare is a project which allows people to report incidents to the zone they are. Zones are
        defined by admins of accounts. The user can interact via chat with the admin (who is going
        to attend the user needs). The project is developed using Laravel Framework and
        \textbf{AngularJS}. \\
        \underline{Approximate contribution:} 85\% of the \textbf{AngularJS} application. \\
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Software Engineering Intern at Talos Digital, Inc.} \\
\textit{July 2015 - January 2016 (6 months)} \\
Full-stack developer. Working in micro-services back end in \textbf{Ruby on Rails}, using
\textbf{Grape} framework. Started learning and developing front end applications using
\textbf{AngularJS}, HTML and CSS.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{TaskFlex} \\
        \textit{August 2015 - December 2015 (5 months)} \\
        TaskFlex is an open-source project and reverse auction platform wich allows Owners to post
        and manage their jobs and Taskers to apply for different job offers. It allows to handle
        almost any service you want. The heavy logic about users and jobs is delegated to TDJobs and
        TDUser microservices. TaskFlex is built using \textbf{AngularJS} and Less.js. \\
        \underline{Approximate contribution:} 85\% of the \textbf{AngularJS} application. \\
                                              60\% of the \textbf{Ruby on Rails} back end.

  \item \textbf{TDJobs} \\
        \textit{July 2015 - November 2015 (5 months)} \\
        Marketplace process abstraction API, built with \textbf{Ruby on Rails} and \textbf{Grape} on
        Docker, to handle jobs supply \& demand logic for applications with a business model like
        that of Task Rabbit or UpWork. \\
        \underline{Approximate contribution:} 40\% of the \textbf{Ruby on Rails} back end. \\
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Teacher Assistant in Data Structures and Algorithms II at Universidad EAFIT} \\
\textit{January 2015 - June 2015 (6 months)} \\
Teaching data structures as maps, sets, trees; and common Computer Science algorithms for Graphs,
Dynamic Programming, Pattern Searching and Ad Hoc solutions.

\textbf{Mobile Devices Developer at IdeasLab} \\
\textit{July 2013 - June 2014 (1 year)} \\
Duing was a social application for mobile devices. My team and I developed the \textbf{Android}
native application for this platform, that required knowledge for development \textbf{graphic
components and obtaning data from Web Services}. \\
\underline{Approximate contribution:} 85\% of the \textbf{Android} application. \\

\textbf{University projects at Universidad EAFIT} \\
\textit{January 2012 - Now} \\
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Nower}: is a mobile application which offers the users different promos for several
        stores, that is, you can look in a map for near stores in a range, see the promos they offer
        and take one. The application will give you a promo code which is used to redeem the promo
        in the store.\\
        The idea goes further than described above.\\
        \emph{We (my university team) started developing this idea in 2015-1, and we are going to
              continue developing it.}\\
        \underline{Approximate contribution:} 90\% of the \textbf{Ruby on Rails} back end. \\
                                              20\% of the \textbf{Android} native application.
  \item Simple games developed in \textbf{Java}.
  \item A queue manager for \textbf{Android}, that is, request turns and being notified by mobile.
  \item A Web Image Hosting Application developed in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and PHP.
  \item CoffeeShop Cashier Application developed in Assembler.
  \item Several \textit{Coding Dojos} using Ionic Framework for \textbf{AngularJS}.
  \item Programming Labs developed in \textbf{C++} in order to understand specific Operating Systems
        concepts.

\textbf{Competitive Programming Seminar Student Coordinator at Universidad EAFIT} \\
Lecturer and student coordinator \\
\textit{January 2014 - Now (2 years 2 months)} \\
Coordinating students and teaching several Computer Science topics involved in Competitive
Programming Contests, such as \textbf{Dynamic Programming}, Greedy Algorithms, Pattern Matching;

\textbf{Mobile Devices Development Seminar at Universidad EAFIT} \\
\textit{Member} \\
\textit{January 2015 - July 2015 (6 months)} \\
I joined this seminar because I really like developing for mobile devices, specially for
\textbf{Android}. In this seminar we created applications from good ideas that could help
students in their life. I've been through two projects in this group.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Campus Móvil:} This application allowed EAFIT University students to easily locate
                               buildings and important places inside the campus.
  \item \textbf{Exams:} \emph{(Not completed yet)} The idea was to have a data base of previous
                        exams of a particular subject. User could upload a picture of his own exam
                        (share it), and search for exams by subject name, teacher name and other
                        parameters.
